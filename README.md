Truck Fleet Analysis Project

Overview
This project analyzes trucking data for California to gain insights into the state's trucking fleet. The objective is to clean the given data, create tables using Hive, load the data, create a new table for rating using Pig Script, connect Hadoop to Power BI, and create visualizations.

Data
The data provided for this project is in CSV format and includes information on truck models, miles per gallon, fuel type, and other related attributes.

Technologies Used
Hive
Pig
Hadoop
Power BI

Steps Involved
1. Data Cleaning:
Involves removing null values, correcting errors, and transforming the data into a usable format.
2. Creating Tables Using Hive:
Creates tables in Hive using HQL (Hive Query Language).
3. Loading Data:
Loads the cleaned data into the tables created in Hive.
4. Creating a New Table for Rating using Pig Script:
Uses Pig Script to create a new table that includes a rating based on the miles per gallon and fuel type.
5. Connecting Hadoop to Power BI:
Connects Power BI to Hadoop using ODBC connector to pull data from Hive.
6. Creating Visualizations:
Creates visualizations in Power BI to analyze the data.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to clean and analyze trucking data using various tools, including Hive, Pig, Hadoop, and Power BI. By following the steps outlined in this project, one can gain valuable insights into the state's trucking fleet, helping to optimize transportation and fuel efficiency.
